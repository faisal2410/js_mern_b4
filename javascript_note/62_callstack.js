// The call stack is a fundamental concept in JavaScript that keeps track of the execution context of a program.It's a data structure that tracks where the program is in its execution and what functions are currently being executed.

// Whenever a function is called in JavaScript, a new execution context is added to the top of the call stack.This execution context includes information about the function being executed, such as its parameters and local variables.

// As the function executes, any new function calls made within it are added to the top of the call stack, creating a stack of nested function calls. When a function returns, its execution context is removed from the top of the call stack, and execution resumes from the function that was called before it.

// This process continues until all functions have been executed and the call stack is empty.

// Here's an example to illustrate how the call stack works:


// function add(x, y) {
//     return x + y;
// }

// function multiply(x, y) {
//     return x * y;
// }

// function calculate(x, y) {
//     const sum = add(x, y);
//     const product = multiply(x, y);
//     return sum + product;
// }

// const result = calculate(3, 4);
// console.log(result);

// In this example, we define three functions: add, multiply, and calculate.calculate calls both add and multiply and returns their sum.

// When the program starts, the calculate function is added to the call stack.As it executes, it calls both add and multiply, which are added to the top of the call stack.Once these functions complete, their execution contexts are removed from the top of the call stack, and execution resumes in calculate.

// Finally, calculate returns the result, which is assigned to result and logged to the console.

//Overall, understanding the call stack is important for understanding how JavaScript functions are executed and how errors can occur when the stack becomes too large.
