// Local storage is a web browser feature that allows web applications to store data locally on a user's device. The stored data persists even after the user closes the browser or restarts their device.

// Here are the basic steps to use local storage in a web application:

// Set an item in local storage:
// To set an item in local storage, use the localStorage.setItem() method and pass in a key - value pair.For example, localStorage.setItem("username", "John");

// Get an item from local storage:
// To get an item from local storage, use the localStorage.getItem() method and pass in the key.For example, let username = localStorage.getItem("username");

// Update an item in local storage:
// To update an item in local storage, use the localStorage.setItem() method and pass in the same key with the updated value.For example, localStorage.setItem("username", "Jane");

// Remove an item from local storage:
// To remove an item from local storage, use the localStorage.removeItem() method and pass in the key.For example, localStorage.removeItem("username");

// Local storage can store only string key - value pairs.To store other data types such as objects, arrays, or numbers, you need to convert them to strings using methods such as JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse().

//     It's important to use local storage responsibly and securely, and to comply with privacy regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA). Users should be informed about the use of local storage and given the option to opt-out or manage their preferences. Additionally, sensitive data such as passwords or credit card numbers should not be stored in local storage.
