// Here are some basic terms in JavaScript:

// Variable: A container for storing values, which can be a number, string, object, or other data type.

// Function: A block of code that performs a specific task and can be called multiple times throughout your code.

// Conditional statements: Statements that check a condition and execute different code depending on whether the condition is true or false.Examples include if/else statements and switch statements.

// Loops: Statements that execute a block of code repeatedly until a condition is met.Examples include for loops, while loops, and do -while loops.

// Objects: Collections of properties(key - value pairs) that represent a real - world object or concept.

// Arrays: Ordered collections of values, which can be of any data type.

// Strings: A sequence of characters, enclosed in quotation marks, that can be manipulated using various string methods.

// Numbers: Numeric values that can be manipulated using various math operators and methods.

// Boolean: A data type that can be either true or false, used for logical comparisons and conditional statements.

// Events: Actions that occur in the browser, such as clicking a button or submitting a form, which can be captured and responded to using event handlers.

// DOM(Document Object Model): The interface between JavaScript and HTML / CSS, allowing you to manipulate and interact with the contents of a web page.

// Scope: The context in which a variable or function is defined, determining where it can be accessed and manipulated within your code.

// Operators: Symbols used to perform operations on values or variables, such as + for addition or === for strict equality comparison.

// Methods: Functions that are associated with a particular object or data type, allowing you to perform specific actions or operations on that object.

// Classes: A template for creating objects, which encapsulate data and functionality in a single unit.

// Inheritance: The ability of an object to inherit properties and methods from a parent object, allowing you to create more specialized objects that share common functionality.

// Prototype: A way to add methods and properties to an object's constructor function, allowing those methods and properties to be shared among all instances of that object.

// Callbacks: Functions that are passed as arguments to other functions and executed at a later time, often used in asynchronous code.

// Promises: Objects that represent the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation, allowing you to chain together multiple async operations and handle errors more easily.

// Modules: Self - contained units of code that can be imported and exported between different parts of your program, allowing you to organize your code and avoid naming conflicts.

// Arrow functions: A shorthand syntax for defining functions, using the => arrow operator to separate the function parameters from the function body.

// Template literals: A way to create strings using backticks(`) instead of quotation marks, allowing you to embed variables and expressions directly in the string using ${...} syntax.

// Spread operator: An operator(denoted by ...) that allows you to expand an array or object into individual elements, making it easier to pass them as arguments or combine them with other arrays / objects.


// Destructuring: A syntax for extracting values from arrays or objects and assigning them to variables in a more concise way.

// Async / await: A modern way of handling asynchronous code in JavaScript, allowing you to write code that looks more like synchronous code but still behaves asynchronously.

// Event loop: The mechanism by which JavaScript handles asynchronous operations, allowing it to run multiple tasks in parallel and respond to user input without blocking the main thread.

// Call stack: A data structure that tracks the order in which functions are called in your code, allowing JavaScript to know which function to return to when a function completes.

// Closure: A way of creating functions that can access variables from their parent function even after the parent function has completed execution.

// Hoisting: A behavior of JavaScript where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes, allowing them to be used before they are declared.

// Strict mode: A mode in JavaScript that enforces stricter rules for code quality and prohibits certain unsafe practices.

// Type coercion: The automatic conversion of one data type to another data type, which can sometimes lead to unexpected behavior in JavaScript.

// NaN: A special value in JavaScript that stands for "Not a Number", often returned by math - related operations that result in an undefined or non - numeric value.

// Truthy / falsy: A concept in JavaScript where certain values are considered "truthy"(i.e.they evaluate to true in a boolean context) and others are considered "falsy"(i.e.they evaluate to false in a boolean context).

// Scoping: The concept of how variables and functions are accessible within different parts of your code, often determined by where they are defined.

// Object - oriented programming(OOP): A programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of objects and classes to encapsulate data and behavior in a reusable way.


// Prototype: An object that serves as a template for other objects, allowing them to inherit properties and methods.

// Inheritance: The mechanism by which objects can inherit properties and methods from their parent objects.

// Encapsulation: The practice of grouping data and behavior together in a single unit(such as an object) to prevent direct external access to the data.

// Polymorphism: The ability of objects to take on multiple forms or behaviors, often achieved through inheritance and method overriding.

// Abstraction: The practice of hiding complex implementation details and exposing only the essential features of an object or function.

// Module: A self - contained unit of code that can be imported and used in other parts of your code, often used to organize and modularize larger codebases.

// Regular expression: A pattern - matching language used to search for and manipulate text in strings.

// Callback function: A function that is passed as an argument to another function and executed at a later time, often used to handle asynchronous operations.

// Promise: A JavaScript object representing the eventual completion(or failure) of an asynchronous operation and allowing for more structured handling of asynchronous code.

// Arrow function: A shorter and more concise syntax for defining functions in JavaScript, often used in functional programming and with higher - order functions.

// Spread syntax: A syntax for expanding an iterable(such as an array) into individual elements, often used for passing multiple arguments to a function or combining arrays.

// Rest parameter: A syntax for collecting multiple arguments into an array within a function, allowing for flexible function signatures.

// Template literal: A syntax for creating strings that allows for embedding expressions and variables within the string, making it easier to construct complex strings.

// Event: An action or occurrence that happens in the browser, such as a click, hover, or load event.

// Event listener: A function that is attached to an element and waits for a specific event to occur, triggering the execution of the function.

// DOM(Document Object Model): A tree - like representation of an HTML document that allows JavaScript to interact with and manipulate the elements and content of a webpage.

// Node: A single element in the DOM tree, such as an HTML tag or text node.

// Query selector: A method for selecting elements from the DOM based on CSS selectors, allowing for dynamic manipulation of the webpage.

// IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression): A function that is executed as soon as it is defined, often used for encapsulation and preventing global variable pollution.

// Hoisting: A behavior in JavaScript where function and variable declarations are moved to the top of their scope, allowing them to be used before they are declared.

// Strict mode: A mode in JavaScript that enables stricter syntax rules and disallows certain actions(such as undeclared variables), helping to prevent errors and encourage best practices.

// Prototype chain: The chain of prototype objects that an object inherits from, allowing for inheritance and method resolution.


// Constructor function: A function that is used to create and initialize objects with the same structure and behavior, often used with the "new" keyword.

// Class: A newer syntax in JavaScript for creating constructor functions and organizing code into reusable and modular components.
