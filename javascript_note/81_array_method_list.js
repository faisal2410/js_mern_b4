Certainly! Here are some of the most commonly used array methods in JavaScript:

push(): Adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length.
pop(): Removes the last element from an array and returns that element.
shift(): Removes the first element from an array and returns that element.
unshift(): Adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the new length.
concat(): Combines two or more arrays and returns a new array.
join(): Joins all elements of an array into a string.
slice(): Extracts a portion of an array into a new array.
splice(): Changes the contents of an array by removing, replacing, or adding elements.
indexOf(): Returns the first index at which a given element is found in an array, or -1 if not found.
lastIndexOf(): Returns the last index at which a given element is found in an array, or -1 if not found.
includes(): Checks if an array contains a specific element and returns true or false.
isArray(): Checks if a value is an array.
forEach(): Executes a provided function once for each array element.
map(): Creates a new array with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the array.
filter(): Creates a new array with all elements that pass a test provided by a function.
reduce(): Applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value.
every(): Checks if all elements in an array pass a test provided by a function.
some(): Checks if at least one element in an array passes a test provided by a function.
find(): Returns the first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function.
findIndex(): Returns the index of the first element in an array that satisfies a provided testing function.
These are just a few of the many methods available for working with arrays in JavaScript. Each method serves a specific purpose and can be combined to perform complex operations on arrays.

I hope this list helps you become familiar with the commonly used array methods in JavaScript. If you have any further questions or need more clarification on any specific method, feel free to ask!
